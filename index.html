										<p>Hello, I'm Hikaru Hosoya! I'm a Korean major, and I'm going to study abroad in Korea next year! 
											So I thought it might be embarrassing if I don't know anything about Korean culture when I go to Korea, 
											so I did some research on Korean culture this time. 
											I'd like to introduce you to one of the most famous cultures,'Sol-Ral' and 'Chuseok'..</p>

											<h3>Sol-Ral</h3>
											<p>The first day of the first month of the lunar calendar is called Sol-Ral.
											The first day of the first month of the lunar calendar is called Sol-Ral (ÏÑ§ÎÇ†).„ÄÄ
It is one of the two most celebrated festivals in Korea, along with Chuseok and Ï∂îÏÑù.

The date changes every year, but it is usually from the end of January to the middle of February.
Tea ceremonies are held on the occasion of Sorral and Autumn Festival. During the ceremony, special offerings are made to the gods. After the tea ceremony, people go to visit the graves of their ancestors.
We greet each other's relatives and neighbors with a greeting called toshihai seiyuu.
We bow in order to the elderly and superiors, and exchange prayers, congratulations, and Âæ∑Ë´áÎçïÎã¥.

üîë ÏÉàÌï¥ Î≥µ Î∞õÏúºÏÑ∏Ïöî.
    Please take lots of blessings in the New Year.
‚ÜíHappy New Year!
											With the arrival of the New Year, people dress themselves in new clothes, shoes, socks, etc., as a sign of a fresh start. These clothes are called "Seolbim," and children wear colorful Hanbok as their new clothes. The color of the hanbok is meant to ward off bad luck and longevity.

The most common traditional foods eaten at Sorral are Îñ°Íµ≠, a soup made with rice cakes and vegetables, and Ï†Ñ, small pieces of grilled vegetables and meat, similar to tempura in Japan.

New Year's games are also an essential part of the festival. Not only children but also adults enjoy these games together. Among the many folk games, kite flying and spinning are the most popular.
